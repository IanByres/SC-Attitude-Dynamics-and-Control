# SC-Attitude-Dynamics-and-Control
Simulink model that determines Earths magnetic field vector throughout flight, computes the necessary torque required to keep SC Nadir pointing, and compares to available magnetic dipole from set of three magnetorquers to verify SC control system is able to keep attitude within required range.
